# Koshino's effective model of Magic-Angle Twisted Bilayer Graphene

This model describes the MATBG low-energy band structure through a list of hopping integrals $t\left( r_{ij} \right)$ between maximally localized Wannier orbitals. These orbitals have a three-peak form, with peaks at AA spots, and are centered at nonequivalent BA (orbital 1) and AB (orbital 2) spots in the emergent moiré pattern, which creates the alternating honeycomb lattice used to calculate the band structure.

Orbitals for valley $\xi = +$ are the complex conjugate of $\xi = -$. Due to symmetries under rotation, the orbitals are $p_\xi \equiv p_x + i\xi p_y$ $\left( \xi = \pm \right)$. The effective model is then constructed by hopping integrals between $\left( p_x, p_y \right)$ orbitals. Each hopping integral is a complex number — but among the nearest five integrals, only $t_2$ has a non-zero imaginary component, due to a "hexagonal warping effect in orbital space".
