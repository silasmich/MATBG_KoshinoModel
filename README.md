# Koshino's model of Magic-Angle Twisted Bilayer Graphene

This model starts from the constructed maximally localized Wannier orbitals in the continuum model. These have a three-peak form at AA spots and are centered at nonequivalent BA (orbital 1) and AB (orbital 2) spots in the emergent moiré pattern, creating an alternating honeycomb lattice. The orbitals for valley ξ = + are the complex conjugate of ξ = -, so the center of orbitals 1 and 2 are switched (?). Due to symmetries under rotation, there orbitals are p_ξ ≡ p_x + iξp_y. The effective model is then constructed by hopping integrals between (p_x, p_y) orbitals.

Each hopping integral is a complex number, but among the nearest five integrals, only t_2 has a non-zero imaginary component, due to "hexagonal warping effect in orbital space".
