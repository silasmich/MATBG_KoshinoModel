# Koshino's effective model of Magic-Angle Twisted Bilayer Graphene

This model describes the MATBG low-energy band structure through a list of hopping integrals $t_{ij}$ between maximally localized Wannier orbitals.

These orbitals have a three-peak form at AA spots and are centered at nonequivalent BA (orbital 1) and AB (orbital 2) spots in the emergent moiré pattern, creating an alternating honeycomb lattice. The orbitals for valley $\xi = +$ are the complex conjugate of $\xi = -$, so the center of orbitals 1 and 2 are switched (?). Due to symmetries under rotation, there orbitals are $p_\xi \equiv p_x + i\xi p_y$. The effective model is then constructed by hopping integrals between $(p_x, p_y)$ orbitals.

Each hopping integral is a complex number, but among the nearest five integrals, only $t_2$ has a non-zero imaginary component, due to "hexagonal warping effect in orbital space".
